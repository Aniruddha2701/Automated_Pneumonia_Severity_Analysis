# Project Structure Overview
## Automated Pneumonia Severity Analysis from Chest X-Ray Images
## using Deep Learning and Image Processing Techniques

---

## 1. Project Objective
This project aims to analyze chest X-ray images and classify pneumonia severity
using a structured pipeline that combines image processing techniques and deep
learning. The project is academic in nature and focuses on understanding,
implementation, and evaluation rather than clinical deployment.

## 4. Responsibility Split (For Viva Reference)

- Dataset selection and organization → Student
- Image preprocessing → Student
- Dataset splitting and labeling → Student
- Feature learning and classification → Deep Learning Model
- Result interpretation → Student

---

## 5. Important Notes
- This project is software-based and academic.
- Public datasets are used.
- Severity labels are approximated for learning purposes.
- The system acts as a decision-support tool, not a clinical diagnostic system.

## 6. Locked Reference Statement

"Our project follows a structured pipeline where chest X-ray images are first
preprocessed using image processing techniques to ensure consistent and high-quality
input. A deep learning model then automatically learns visual patterns from these
images and classifies pneumonia severity. Finally, the results are evaluated and
analyzed to understand model performance and limitations."
